## What this is

**AIPCC — AI-Powered Cybersecurity Co-Pilot.** Ingests security logs (CSV / JSON / TXT / LOG), runs a
RAG pipeline over them, and produces structured security reports: attack types (MITRE-mapped), risk
assessment, vulnerabilities (CVE/CWE), anomalies, and an event timeline. Also provides a
"talk to your data" chat over ingested documents, a threat-intel enrichment path, and file-integrity
monitoring.

**This repo is a ground-up rebuild.** A working prototype exists (university group project, 7
contributors) which proved the RAG + report concept but was incomplete and structurally broken.
Its RAG/report logic is being ported; nothing else is. See `PORTING.md`.

**Purpose: portfolio.** Optimize for clean architecture, reproducibility (one-command run), and
tests — over feature count. A reviewer should be able to clone, run `docker compose up`, log in with
seed credentials, and see a populated app.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic |
| DB | PostgreSQL 16 (via Docker locally; managed Postgres in deploy) |
| Vector store | Chroma, `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings |
| LLM | Provider abstraction — Gemini (default), Ollama (local), Groq. Set `LLM_PROVIDER`. |
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite, react-router-dom, Tailwind, TanStack Query |
| Automation | n8n (report orchestrator + file-integrity engine) |
| Auth | OAuth2 password flow, bcrypt, JWT |

## Commands

```bash
# Full stack (primary path)
docker compose up                  # backend + frontend + postgres + n8n
docker compose up postgres -d      # just the DB

# Backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
alembic upgrade head               # apply migrations
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"
python -m app.db.seed              # seed demo data (never automatic)
pytest

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Conventions

- **Env access only through `app/core/config.py`.** No bare `os.getenv` anywhere else.
- **Pydantic schemas are the contract.** The report generator and the DB-storage layer must use the
  *same* schema objects — field names must never be duplicated as string literals in two places.
  (The prototype's #1 bug was exactly this drift.)
- **Routers stay thin.** Business logic lives in `services/`, DB access in `db/`.
- **Every new endpoint gets a test.** Minimum: happy path + auth rejection.
- **Frontend server state goes through TanStack Query.** No `fetch` in components.
- **Absolute imports** in frontend via `@/` alias.

## Hard rules — never reintroduce these

These are the specific defects of the prototype. Reintroducing one is a regression:

1. **Never call `Base.metadata.drop_all()` / `create_all()` at import time.** The prototype wiped its
   database on every boot. Schema changes go through Alembic only.
2. **Never hardcode a `current_user`.** The user comes from the JWT via `get_current_user`.
3. **Never store plaintext passwords.** bcrypt, always.
4. **Never render pages without a router.** The prototype stacked every page in `App.jsx`.
5. **Never let LLM output reach the DB unvalidated.** Parse → validate against the Pydantic schema →
   retry once on failure → typed error. No silent `except: pass`.
6. **No debug UI in committed code.** No "DEBUG: App mounted" banners.

## LLM policy

One story, not three. `LLM_PROVIDER` selects the backend:
- `gemini` (default) — runnable with a single API key, so a reviewer can start it easily.
- `ollama` — local execution, the data-sovereignty story. Documented, optional.
- `groq` — used by the n8n orchestrator.

The README must describe what the code actually does. The prototype's README claimed local Ollama and
AES-256 encryption that did not exist — do not repeat that.

## Motion / video assets

Already produced and optimized — do not regenerate:
- `frontend/public/video/` — 7 clips (MP4 + WebM + posters). Read `manifest.md` before using any of
  them; it contains hard usage rules (never two moving things at once, motion behind content only).
- `frontend/src/components/motion/` — 4 dependency-free CSS/SVG feature animations.

Ambient motion plays for all users. The **only** `prefers-reduced-motion` gate in the app is skipping
the intro clip's full-screen flash.

## Current status

Phase 0 (bootstrap). See `AIPCC_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md` for the phase sequence and
`AIPCC_REBUILD_PLAN.md` for the full architecture rationale.

**Update this section at the end of every phase.**
